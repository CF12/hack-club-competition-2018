# Gift Finder

üéÅ *This project was created for the Hack Club Holiday Challenge (2018) - More info can be found here: [Link](https://hackclub.com/)*

It's hard to find the perfect gift for <s>yourself</s> your friends during the holiday season. Some people love board games. Others love gift cards. Some don't give a crap.

It's time to please those who don't give a crap.

Introducing the ALL NEW GIFT FINDER 2018 - the best way to please those friends that don't give a crap.

In all seriousness, I browsed Amazon for like a solid hour, finding and categorizing what I thought would be decent gifts for someone.

If you thought what I made was cool, please upvote my submission on the [challenge submission page](https://hackclub.com/challenge/) for the Hack Club Holiday Challenge.
